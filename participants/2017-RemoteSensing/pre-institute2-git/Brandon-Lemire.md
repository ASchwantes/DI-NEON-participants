Domain for Research: Southern Rockies and Colorado Plateau

Goal: I am interested in reviewing data management and program structure employed by NEON to see what might benefit the National Park Service Remote Sensing program.  This research will be integrated with the program plan being implemented to provide NPS with a successful national program.

Capstone Project Idea: My Capstone project will be an extension of the project that I used to complete my watershed science degree.  My current project incorporated USGS gauging data along with Snotel data to look at how climate changes might affect surface flow rates within the Copper Mountain watershed.  It is important to observe relationships between climate shifts within the watershed and surface flow rates within Tenmile Creek.

The domain of focus for this project will be the north and eastern section of the Southern Rockies and Colorado Plateau.  The climate data that is available from NEON will be incorporated with Snotel and any MSS high resolution imagery over the study area.  It will extend the project completed to see how incorporating NEON data and high resolution imagery into the previous work will improve models developed and results produced.  I will also be able to incorporate the results into vegetative and hydrologic work being done within various NPS units.
