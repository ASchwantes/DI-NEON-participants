Hi there! I just finished my first year as a geography Ph.D. student at Boston University in the Department of Earth and Environment. I am originally from Texas and got my undergraduate degree in environmental science/biology at The University of Texas at Austin. Broadly, I am interested in the using remote sensing to measure canopy nitrogen in temperate forests of New England.  

One of my course goals is to learn more about how to integrate NEON AOP imagery along with other remotely sensed data (i.e. Landsat or Sentinel data) for my dissertation research focused on remote sesing of forest canopy chemistry and structure.

When I'm not working on school, I enjoy:
* practicing yoga
* biking
* listening to podcasts
* cooking

## Capstone Project

Because of its central role in photosynthesis, nitrogen availability is an important constraint on carbon cycling. Past research has shown that canopy nitrogen concentration is strongly and positively correlated with both shortwave surface albedo (Ollinger et al. 2008) and near infrared (NIR) reflectance (Sullivan et al. 2013). Lepine et al. (2015) demonstrated that high spectral resolution imagery is not necessary to estimate forest canopy %N from NIR bands, and that sensor radiometric quality is actually more important. With the launch of Sentinel-2A in 2015 and Sentinel-2B in 2017, the land remote sensing community now has access to unprecedented quality and quantity of multispectral imagery. In addition to providing conventional NIR measurements, Sentinel-2 also has “red-edge” bands and an extra NIR band available to estimate canopy traits including chlorophyll and nitrogen content (Clevers and Gitelson, 2012).
 
I am interested in investigating how the growing season phenology of Sentinel-2 imagery can be used to improve understanding of canopy-scale chlorophyll and nitrogen dynamics, between and within growing seasons. In addition to Sentinel-2 data, I will also be using NEON airborne data (including LIDAR imagery and canopy chemical measurements) in association with field measurements (such as the biochemical NEON measurements) to understand how the structural properties forest canopies (e.g., canopy composition and gap structure) influence reflectance measurements from space-borne sensors. These latter measurements, in addition to being important for interpreting remotely sensed imagery, are critical for modeling and interpreting nutrient cycles in forest communities (Shugart et al. 2010).
