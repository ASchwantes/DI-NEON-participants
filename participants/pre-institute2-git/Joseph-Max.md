I am part of the Analytics Hub with Earth Lab and Research Computing at the University of Colorado Boulder.
My background is in hierarchical Bayesian modeling and disease dynamics, but much of my current work involves writing scientific software to make data more useful.
I am hoping to become more proficient with remotely sensed data by taking this course, so that I can more effectively integrate data from different sources.

Mosquitoes are the worst.
But on windy days, they don't seem so bad.
What exactly is the relationship between wind velocity and mosquito abundance?
I propose find out by modeling mosquito trapping data as a function of 2D wind speed data.

First, we will need to identify stations and time intervals with overlapping wind velocity and mosquito trapping data.
Second, we will temporally align these two datasets so that each "data point" has a value of wind speed and mosquito abundance, probably averaged within some time intervals (e.g., hours or days) within locations (e.g., NEON sites).
Last, we will construct a statistical model to evaluate how mosquito capture data relates to wind speed.
