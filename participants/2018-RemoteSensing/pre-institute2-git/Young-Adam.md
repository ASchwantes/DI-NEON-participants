\f0\fs22 \cf0 ## Bio\
My name is Adam, and I am a new postdoc at Northern Arizona University (NAU) in Dr. Andrew Richardson\'92s lab. I just finished my Ph.D. at the University of Idaho this past spring, with my dissertation investigating climate-change impacts on fire regimes in boreal forest and Arctic ecosystems. At NAU, I am now working on an NSF project focused on understanding how ecosystem phenology acts as a control of biosphere-atmosphere coupling across an ecoclimatic gradient in the US. This gradient includes three broad spatial domains: the US Southwest, Great Plains, and Northeast. While participating in the data institute, one specific goal of mine is to be become better acquainted with version-control practices using Github, to aid in collaborative research.\

## Capstone Project\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 For my Capstone Project, I am broadly interested in conducting work that willl contribute to a data synthesis using PhenoCam imagery and data from the AmeriFlux/FLUXNET networks. More specifically, I am interested in working/collaborating on a Capstone Project geared towards exploring relationships between phenological transitions and surface-atmosphere fluxes of energy, water, and carbon.\
\
While I am interested in using any sites from the PhenoCam network that are also co-located with AmeriFlux or FLUXNET sites, potential NEON core sites I would be interested in using are:\
- *Northeast*: HARV (Harvard Forest)\
- *Great Plains*: KONZ (Konza Prairie)\
- *Southwest*: SRER (Santa Rita)}
