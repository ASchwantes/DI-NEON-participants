##Name: Cassondra Walker

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Integrative Biology at Oklahoma State University.

## Interests:

I study how environmental conditions operate at different spatial scales (extent and grain) to constrain species distributions. I use remotely sensed data to quantify environmental conditions across differing spatial extents and resolutions.  I currently collect my own terrestrial LiDAR to quantify vertical structure at fine spatial scales. I am also interested in the scaling properties of LiDAR derived metrics; for example, how airborne collected point clouds can be modeled to terrestrial collected point clouds.

##Goals for the NEON course:

I am looking forward to learing how to work with remote sensing data in R.
I am also looking forward to learing the capabilites and limitations of working with NEON data.
